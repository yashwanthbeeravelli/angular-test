#Instructions

You must create a weather logging app that allows users to enter temperatures in order to calculate its median, average, highest and lowest points.

You will be provided with a MEAN stack development environment which you should use to do your work.

You will have 24 hours to do this test. We do not expect you to complete every single user stories in that amount of time.

We will evaluate you based on:
- How clean your code is;
- The structure of your application;
- How close the UI is to the mockup;
- Your choice of UI architecture;

# Specs:
- Node.js 6 or higher
- Express.js
- Angular 1.5 or higher
- SCSS
- Your choice of npm packages that you may want to use to help you develop this app

# Requirements:
- Write ES2015 JavaScript
- Write your application using Angular components as much as you can (component architecture)
- Replicate the mockup provided to you using SCSS
- Calculate the median, average, highest and lowest temperature in the front-end (using Angular)
- Unit test (bonus)
- Documentation (bonus)

# User Stories:
- As a user, I want to add a temperature to my log
- The input must only take numbers
- You must display a validation error when invalid data is entered in the input
- As a user, I want to delete a temperature from my log
- As a user, I want to see the temperature median in my entire log
- As a user, I want to see the average temperature of my entire log
- As a user, I want to see the highest temperature in my log
- As a user, I want to see the lowest temperature in my log
